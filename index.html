    <p>System integration has many challenges. Most research on this topic tends to focus on the
        technological challenges of systems integration. There is considerable challenge and cost in
        integrating heterogeneous systems, including replacing old hardware and software with newer
        systems, working with IT consultants in developing middleware to facilitate seamless integration, or
        bottlenecks in data integration. The technical challenges are nothing, however, when
        compared with the human challenges that organizations face when integrating systems. The first
        challenge may be with people in the IT department who will have a major impact once the
        systems are integrated in terms of supporting and maintaining the new system. Other human
        challenges will come from the functional department heads who will lose control over the data
        produced from their areas. Another challenge is curbing the rumors and fears on job layoffs that
        accompany a systems integration project. Overcoming these fears and curbing the turf battles is
        critical for the success of a systems integration project. Getting employee buy-in on the systems
        integration project is very critical for the success of integrated systems</p>
